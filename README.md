### Trapped Within a Web

You wake up in a cramped, silent cell. No memories, no answers, just cold concrete and the faint hum of something watching. Each day, a metal door slides open and a voice orders you through the same routines: eat, sleep, repeat. The room never changes…

But the spiders do.
